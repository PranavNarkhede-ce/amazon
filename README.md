A simple Amazon homepage clone built using HTML and CSS.
This is my first project in web development, created to practice basic frontend concepts and improve my understanding of layout, styling, and page structure.

Project Overview:
This project replicates the look and feel of Amazon’s homepage using only HTML and CSS.
It focuses on layout design, responsiveness basics, and visual styling — without any JavaScript or backend functionality.
